## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e1a358: Add `primaryColor` prop to ThemeProvider to allow custom primary color configuration. The primary color automatically generates all variant colors (solid, outline, ghost, weak) and disabled states. Each ThemeProvider instance can independently set its own primary color using CSS variables scoped to its container element.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 26d6a48: Fix border styling consistency in Badge and Button components by explicitly setting borderColor and updating border property usage.
