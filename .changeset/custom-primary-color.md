Add `primaryColor` prop to ThemeProvider to allow custom primary color configuration. The primary color automatically generates all variant colors (solid, outline, ghost, weak) and disabled states. Each ThemeProvider instance can independently set its own primary color using CSS variables scoped to its container element.
